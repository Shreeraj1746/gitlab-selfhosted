# Project Status as of May 13, 2025

## Current Progress

#### Environment Bootstrap
- **Bootstrap Script**: Created `bootstrap.sh` to detect and validate required tools.
- **AWS Profile Selection**: Added interactive AWS profile selection.

#### Terraform Configuration
- **`main.tf`**: Defined core infrastructure (VPC, subnet, security group, EC2 instance).
- **`variables.tf`**: Updated to deploy all resources in `ap-south-1`.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Added outputs for VPC ID, subnet ID, and SSH connection string.
- **`providers.tf`**: Configured AWS provider with default tags and region.

#### Ansible Configuration
- **`site.yml`**: Created playbook to install and configure GitLab CE.
  - Tasks include updating packages, installing dependencies, adding the GitLab repository, configuring the external URL, and ensuring GitLab is running.

#### Makefile
- **`Makefile`**: Created to automate deployment, verification, and cleanup.
  - `make deploy`: Runs Terraform and Ansible.
  - `make verify`: Performs smoke tests (HTTP 200, SSH clone, dry-run backup).
  - `make destroy`: Cleans up resources.

#### Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated with deployment steps, verification, cleanup, architecture diagram, and cost table.
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Updated with Makefile details, verification steps, and error handling.

### Next Steps
1. Run Ansible playbook to configure GitLab.
2. Perform verification tests and document results.

## Notes
- All configurations are being designed to comply with AWS Free Tier limits.
- No deviations from the provided implementation plan so far.
